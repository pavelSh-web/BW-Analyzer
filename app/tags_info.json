  },
  {
    "name": "Reverberation",
    "description": "The sound of an acoustic environment that includes substantial reflection from multiple walls or other hard surfaces. Reverberation is generally perceived as being able to 'hear' the presence and size of the room or space in which the sound is made.  The reflected sounds should remain audible for hundreds of milliseconds or longer."
  },
  {
    "name": "Echo",
    "description": "A sound which is a delayed and attenuated repetition of an earlier sound, for example because the sound wave has been reflected back from a distant, planar surface. To be perceived as an echo, the repetion must be delayed by around 100 milliseconds or more."
  },
  {
    "name": "Noise",
    "description": "A sound that has no perceptible structure and that typically interferes with the perception of more interesting or important sounds."
  },
  {
    "name": "Background noise",

  },
  {
    "name": "Tape hiss",

    "description": "A crackling or hissing noise caused by electrical interference."
  },
  {
    "name": "Mains hum",
    "description": "A low, continuous tone caused by electromagnetic interference from the alternating current of the mains electricity. The fundamental frequency of this sound is usually 50 Hz or 60 Hz, depending on the local power-line frequency."
  },
  {
    "name": "Distortion",
    "description": "A sound that has been modified in a nonlinear fashion, usually in electronic equipment, to introduce sound correlated with the original signal. In many cases, notably with amplified electric musical instruments, distortion is introduced as an effect by increasing the gain and clipping the source signal."
  },
  {
    "name": "Sidetone",
    "description": "The audible feedback on a telecommunications channel that allows the speaker to know that the channel is operational."

  },
  {
    "name": "White noise",
    "description": "A random, unstructured sound in which the value at any moment provides no information about the value at any other moment. White noise has equal energy in all frequency bands."
  },
  {
    "name": "Pink noise",
    "description": "Unstructured noise whose energy decreases with frequency such that equal amounts of energy are distributed in logarithmic bands of frequency, typically octaves.  Pink noise sounds more like a rumble where white noise sounds like a hiss."
